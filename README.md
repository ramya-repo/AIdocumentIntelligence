## Configuration

### Streamlit Configuration
The `.streamlit/config.toml` file contains server settings:
```toml
[server]
headless = true
address = "0.0.0.0"
port = 5000
```

### Token Limits
The application automatically handles large documents by:
- Truncating content to stay within OpenAI's token limits
- Limiting chat history to recent messages
- Smart truncation at sentence boundaries

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"OpenAI API key not found" error**
   - Make sure you've set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
   - Verify your API key is correct and active

2. **"Request too large" error**
   - The application automatically handles this, but very large documents may still cause issues
   - Try uploading smaller documents or sections of large files

3. **File processing errors**
   - Ensure your files are not corrupted
   - Check that file formats are supported (.pdf, .docx, .doc, .xlsx, .xls)
   - Some password-protected files may not work

4. **Streamlit won't start**
   - Make sure all dependencies are installed
   - Check that port 5000 is not being used by another application
   - Try using a different port: `streamlit run app.py --server.port 8501`

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the terminal/console for error messages
2. Verify all dependencies are installed correctly
3. Ensure your OpenAI API key is valid and has credits
4. Try with a smaller test document first
