pyproject.toml file is already properly configured with all the necessary dependencies for the AI document chatbot:
streamlit - for the web interface
openai - for AI responses
pandas - for Excel file processing
pypdf2 - for PDF file processing
python-docx and docx - for Word document processing
openpyxl - for Excel file processing
The file is in the right place and contains all the required packages. Your chatbot should work perfectly with this setup. You can now upload documents (PDF, Word, or Excel files) and start asking questions about their content.
